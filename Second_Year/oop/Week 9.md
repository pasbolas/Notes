We discussing about data types.

char --> 16 bits
byte --> 8 bits
int --> 32 bits
short --> 16 bits
long --> 64 bits
float --> 32 bits
double --> 64 bits


### Boolean 
We discussing direct implementation of boolean, like while(condition) type loops....

## Wrapper Class 
there is always a class associated with the primitive data type like

int has a wrapper class like Integer 

Why they exist in first place : 
--> maybe because they have built in method 
--> in array list you cant use primitive data type so we use wrapper class as it converts them to object 

## Primitive vs Reference

# 1. 

```java
	int accoutnNum = 1234; 
	Integer accoutNum = new Integer(1234); %% reference (is now deprecated) %%
	Integer accoutNum = 1234; %% autoboxing  %%
```



### Note

int x1 =  1; <--- does hold the value

Integer x1 = new  Integer(1); <---- x1 holds the reference to object that stores the value 1



# 2. 



donno gang what to put here

### Operator




### Note :
.equals()
@Override
well throw this into every single class you make for no apparent reason.


### Question here
what if in definiton we ask for another object, but what if we input another method which returns s2,  will this work?


boolean true_or_false = s1.equals(g1.result());
