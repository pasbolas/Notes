## What is a Flowchart in Computer Science?

A **flowchart** is a **diagram that visually represents the sequence of steps, decisions, and processes in a program or algorithm**. It uses **symbols** to show **how data and control move through a system**.














# There is a notation....

Oval is used To mark the start and end of the flow chart

1. Start
2. End









### Rectangle

To show calculation being performed, or an action taken.


x = x -1 
y = y + 1












### Diamond

We make decision on this step, it has one inward arrow and 2 outgoing, the decision condition is written inside of it.


x = 5
x <= 0  ----> False


## Comparision Operators
### == means (is equal to)

statement 1 == statement2    ---> True if equal
2 == 2 ---> True
2 == 1 ---> False

## != (not is equal to)

2 != 1 ---> True
2 != 2 ---> False

## >= greater than OR equal to
## <=  less than Or Equal
